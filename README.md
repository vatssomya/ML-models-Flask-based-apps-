## ü©∫ Applications in Detail  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Water Quality Index Prediction**  
   - **Dataset**: Collected from real-world water sample attributes.  
   - **Processing**: Preprocessed, handled missing values, and applied SMOTE for imbalance correction.  
   - **Models Used**: Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, with Random Forest yielding the best results.  
   - **Deployment**: The best model is integrated with Flask for real-time predictions.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Women Empowerment Index Prediction**  
   - **Dataset**: Features include socio-economic, educational, and demographic indicators.  
   - **Processing**: Preprocessing and feature selection to focus on relevant data points.  
   - **Models Used**: Logistic Regression and SVM, with SVM providing the highest accuracy.  
   - **Goal**: Empower stakeholders to address gaps in gender equality.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Education Quality Prediction**  
   - **Dataset**: Includes metrics like student-teacher ratios, attendance, and infrastructure quality.  
   - **Processing**: Data normalization, feature scaling, and outlier removal for model optimization.  
   - **Models Used**: Gradient Boosting and Neural Networks, with Gradient Boosting performing the best.  
   - **Impact**: Aims to guide educators and policymakers to improve learning outcomes.
